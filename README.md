# FindText

## About
This is a simple tool I made in Lazarus to extract lines of text containing a search string from a selected text file.

## Features
-	Add multiple files.
-	Add a directory of text files.
-	Remove selected items from the list box.
-	Clear all items in the list box.
-	Load and Save lists of files.
-	Extract lines of text that are in the search string.
-	Search a list of files when the list becomes too large to see all the files.
-	Extract all the lines in a text file that do not include the search string.
-	Show the line number of the extract lines containing the search string.
-	Option to match or ignore search string case.
-	Save or copy the extract lines.
